                <h1>When you use our services, you’re trusting us with your
                    information. We understand this is a big responsibility and
                    work hard to protect your information and put you in
                    control.
                </h1>
                <p>This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it,
                    and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.
                    <br/>
                    Effective March 31, 2020

                <h2>We want you to understand the types of information we
                    collect as you use our services</h2>
                <p>We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like
                    your food preferences, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people
                    who matter most to you online, or which Pizza places you might like.
                    <br />
                    When you’re not signed in to your Plza Account, we store the information we collect with unique
                    identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This helps us do things like
                    maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions.
                    When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Plza Account, which we
                    treat as personal information.
