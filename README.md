# APIs

## Foursquare

The Foursquare Places API provides location based experiences with diverse information about venues, users, photos, and check-ins. The API supports real time access to places, Snap-to-Place that assigns users to specific locations, and Geo-tag. Additionally, Foursquare allows developers to build audience segments for analysis and measurement. JSON is the preferred response format.

## GeoIP

GeoIP service provides accurate geolocation information based on domain or IP address.

# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own local environment variables. There should be a `.env` file containing the following:

```
REACT_APP_BASE_URL = Local Backend Server e.g "http://localhost:4000/api"
REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN = pk.eyJ1IjoiZ3JlbnV0dGFnIiwiYSI6ImNrMnF1ajFkYzBqMTAzY244bmRpbW5nYW8ifQ.yX9laKkhJ8OmDQkwdnz8Hw
REACT_APP_ENCRYPT_SECRET=PizzaPlza2
```

# Installation Instructions

- Create `.env` file with the above environment variables
- `npm install` to install all required dependancies

### Other Scripts

- `npm run start` to start the app
- `npm run test` to start server using testing environment
- `npm run coverage` to gather test coverage
  |

# Testing

For testing, we've used the following testing modules:

- `@testing-library/react` - light-weight solution for testing React components. It provides light utility functions on top of `react-dom` and `react-dom/test-utils`, in a way that encourages better testing practices.
- `react-test-renderer` - used to render React components to pure JavaScript objects, without depending on the DOM or a native mobile environment.
- `redux-mock-store` - used to test Redux async action creators and middleware. The mock store will create an array of dispatched actions which server as an action log for tests
